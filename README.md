**get_next_line is part of the first milestone of the 42 Common Core**

The PDF of the original subject is attached.

The goal is to implement a function very similar to the getline() function in the C standard library: reading content line by line.

I learnt how to manage static buffers, handle file descriptors, and carefully deal with memory, buffer overflows, and edge cases like newline characters and EOF.

The bonus part requires the function to be able to handle multiple file descriptors at the same time.
